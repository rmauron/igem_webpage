# iGEM Stockholm Webpage

## About

This webpage is for each current iGEM Stockholm to use. 
It is intentionally designed as a single page to keep the message direct and easily accessible.

## How to Use

To make changes to the webpage or preview them locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Project Locally**:
   - [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) if you haven't already.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    Change directory to user directory with this command
    ```
    cd ~
    ```
    Or select where to clone the project

    Clone the project in the selected repository
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/rmauron/igem_webpage.git
     ```

    Once it is cloned, you will have a project of the following structure:

    ```
    .
    ├── README.md
    ├── igem_authors.html
    ├── igem_template.html
    ├── image
    │   ├── image1.jpg
    │   ├── image2.jpg
    │   └── image3.png
    └── mystyle.css
    ```

2. **Making Changes**:
   - Open the project directory in your preferred code editor. I recommend using [Visual Studio Code (VSC)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
   - Modify the `igem_template.html` file to update the webpage content.
   - Adjust the styles in the `style.css` file.
   - Add images in the `image folder`.
   - Contributors should add their contribution on the `igem_authors.html`.

3. **Visualizing Changes Locally**:

It can be difficult to know if the webpage is rendering the way we wished.
To visualize the new webpage, simply save the `igem_template.html` file and open it in your preferred browser (double click on the file). 
The webpage will be open locally without anyone else being able to access it. After each save, you can simply refresh that page to observe the changes.

4. **Uploading the new page**:

If you managed get there, you will know who to ask to get the credentials.
